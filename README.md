# Pizza_Sales
As an analyst, before embarking on this project, I had to think like the business owner first to fully understand the requirements. 
For this dashboard, we have a year's sales data from a Pizzeria, including the date and time of each order and the pizza served with additional details on the type, size, quantity, and price.
The dashboard intents to provide some of the insights to its owners to improve its sales, and product performance and enhance its operations.
